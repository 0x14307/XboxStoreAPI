# xbox-api
Simple web scraper to get games &amp; prices that are on sale on Xbox.

This currently is very barebones. While it can grab the games on sale & their prices, it does not show in a list most would be comfortable viewing with.*

Anyone can use this in a project, as long as (some) credit is given that is fine

*Currently now only the 10 games on sale is shown, this might be expanded in the future soon.
