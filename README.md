# Xbox Store API

This is a web scraper that gets data from the Xbox website of games currently on sale and displays the name, former price, and current sale price.

Currently it isn't a full API (yety) but if you know how to get an express server running you'd probably be fine.

I'm planning to add support to get links to the actual products themselves aswell as some other things. 

PRs accepted. Just make sure to obey the license
