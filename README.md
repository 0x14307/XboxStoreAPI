# Xbox Store API

This is a web scraper that gets data from the Xbox website of games currently on sale and displays the name, former price, and current sale price.

Currently it isn't a full API (yet) but if you know how to get an express server running you'd probably be fine.

Installation currently can be done by cloning and doing `npm i` in the directory and then running `node .`

I'm planning to add support to get links to the actual products themselves aswell as some other things. 

PRs accepted. Just make sure to obey the license
